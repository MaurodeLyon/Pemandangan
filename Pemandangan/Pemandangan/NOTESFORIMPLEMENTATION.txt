Route with routepoints.
draw route with all routepoints.
every routepoint is a mapIcon with a geofence (link every routepoint with a mapicon/geofence).
This way you can find the appropriate routepoint info when a mapicon is clicked or
the appropriate mapicon to change to seen when a geofence is entered.
